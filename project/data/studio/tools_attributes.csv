Tools attributes reference,"Android Studio supports a variety of XML attributes in the tools namespace
that enable design-time features (such as which layout to show in a fragment) or
compile-time behaviors (such as which shrinking mode to apply to your XML
resources). When you build your app, the build tools remove these attributes so
there is no effect on your APK size or runtime behavior.",https://developer.android.com/studio/write/tool-attributes
