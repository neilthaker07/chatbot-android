Add multi-density vector graphics,"Android Studio includes a tool called Vector Asset Studio that helps you add
material icons and import Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) and Adobe Photoshop Document (PSD) files
into your project as vector drawable resources. Using vector drawables instead of bitmaps reduces
the size of your APK because the same file can be resized for different screen densities
without loss of image quality. For older versions of Android that don't support
vector drawables, Vector Asset Studio can, at build time, turn your vector drawables
into different bitmap sizes for each screen density.",https://developer.android.com/studio/write/vector-asset-studio
