Create an Android library,"An Android library is structurally the same as an Android app module.
It can include everything needed to build an app, including source code,
resource files, and an Android manifest.
However, instead of compiling into an APK that runs on a device,
an Android library compiles into an Android Archive (AAR) file that you can use
as a dependency for an Android app module. Unlike JAR files, AAR files can
contain Android resources and a manifest file, which allows you to bundle in
shared resources like layouts and drawables in addition to Java classes and
methods.",https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/android-library
