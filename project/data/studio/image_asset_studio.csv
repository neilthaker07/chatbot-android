Create app icons with Image Asset Studio,"Android Studio includes a tool called Image Asset Studio that helps you generate your own app
 icons from
 material icons,
 custom images, and text strings. It generates a set of icons at the appropriate resolution
 for each pixel
 density that your app supports.
 Image Asset Studio places the newly generated icons in density-specific folders under the
 res/ directory in your project. At runtime, Android uses the appropriate
 resource based on the screen density of the device your app is running on.",https://developer.android.com/studio/write/image-asset-studio
