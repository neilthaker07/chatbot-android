Projects overview,"A project in Android Studio contains everything that defines your
workspace for an app, from source code and assets, to test code and build
configurations. When you start a new project, Android Studio creates the necessary
structure for all your files and makes them visible in the
Project window on the left side of the IDE (click View
> Tool Windows > Project). This page provides an overview of the
key components inside your project.",https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/index
