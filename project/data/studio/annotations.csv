Improve code inspection with annotations,"Using code inspections tools such as Lint can help you find
problems and improve your code, but inspection tools can only infer so much. Android resource IDs,
for example, use an int to identify strings, graphics, colors, and other resource types,
so inspection tools cannot tell when you have specified a string resource where you should have
specified a color. This situation means that your app may render incorrectly or fail to run at all,
even if you use code inspection.",https://developer.android.com/studio/write/annotations
