"Android Runtime","Android includes a set of core libraries that provides most of the functionality available in the corelibraries of the Java programming language. Every Android application runs in its own process. with its own instance of the Dalvik virtual machine. Dalvik has been written so that a device can run multiple VMs efficiently. The Dalvik VM executes files in the Dalvik Executable (.dex) format which is optimized for minimal memory footprint. The VM is register-based. and runs classes compiled by a Java language compiler that have been transformed into the .dex format by the included ?dx? tool.	"
"Dalvik","The name of Androids virtual machine. The Dalvik VM is an interpreter-only virtual machine that executes files in the Dalvik Executable (.dex) format. a format that is optimized for efficient storage and memory-mappable execution. The virtual machine is register-based. and it can run classes compiled by a Java language compiler that have been transformed into its native format using the included ?dx? tool. The VM runs on top of Posix-compliant operating systems. which it relies on for underlying functionality (such as threading and low level memory management). The Dalvik core class library is intended to provide a familiar development base for those used to programming with Java Standard Edition. but it is geared specifically to the needs of a small mobile device.

"Ddms","Dalvik Debug Monitor Service. a GUI debugging application shipped with the SDK. It provides screen capture. log dump. and process examination capabilities.	"
"G1 Phone",The Android T-Mobile G1 phone is the world's first Android-powered mobile phone developed by HTC and T-Mobile.
"Intent Receiver",An application class that listens for messages broadcast by calling Context.broadcastIntent	
"apk Extension?","The extension for an Android package file. which typically contains all of the files related to a single Android application. The file itself is a compressed collection of an AndroidManifest.xml file.application code (.dex files). resource files. and other files. A project is compiled into a single .apk file.	"
"Layout Resource?",An XML file that describes the layout of an Activity screen.	
"Manifest","An XML file associated with each Application that describes the various activies. intent filters. services. and other items that it exposes.	"
"Theme?","A set of properties (text size. background color. and so on) bundled together to define various default display settings. Android provides a few standard themes. listed in R.style (starting with ?Theme_?)."
"Uris?","Android uses URI strings both for requesting data (e.g.. a list of contacts) and for requesting actions (e.g.. opening a Web page in a browser). Both are valid URI strings. but have different values. All requests for data must start with the string ?content://?. Action strings are valid URIs that can be handled appropriately by applications on the device; for example. a URI starting with ?http://? will be handled by the browser.	"
"Action?",A description of something that an Intent sender desires.	
"Intent?","A class (Intent) describes what a caller desires to do. The caller sends this intent to Android's intent resolver. which finds the most suitable activity for the intent.	"
"Resource","A user-supplied XML. bitmap. or other file. injected into the application build process. which can later be loaded from code.	"
"Sticky Intent"," i.e. the Intent you are sending stays around after the broadcast is complete. so that others can quickly retrieve that data through the return value of registerReceiver (BroadcastReceiver. IntentFilter). In all other ways. this behaves the same as sendBroadcast (Intent).
One example of a sticky broadcast sent via the operating system is ACTION_BATTERY_CHANGED. When you call registerReceiver () for that action -- even with a null BroadcastReceiver -- you get the Intent that was last broadcast for that action. Hence. you can use this to find the state of the battery without necessarily registering for all future state changes in the battery.	"
