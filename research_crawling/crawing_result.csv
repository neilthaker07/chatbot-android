Depending on you tablet, you may have the option to set the screen timeout to ""never"" under Settings > Display > Sleep.

If you do not have this option, you can enable Settings > Developer options > Stay awake. This will keep your tablet awake while it is charging. This could be useful if your tablet does not support the ""never"" screen timeout. 

Note: If you don't see Developer options in Settings, it may be made available by going to to Settings > About > Build number. Developer options should appear after tapping the build number several times.
